## Adalab's online training E.5

### üíª What's this?

This is a simple web app created for the online training in Adalab's bootcamp. It's developed by [Alexandra Jara](https://github.com/alexandrajaramz), using JavaScript.

It's a list of ingredients, and the requested features were:
- Select all the ingredients, some or none.
- Change their quantity.
- The final price is always updated with the price of your selected items (in case you have some).
- The purchase button always shows the final price as well.
- The purchase button should go to a final purchase url, but that's not requested in this exercise.
- Don't use ReactJS, but you have to use Bootstrap.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to use

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) (`npm install --global gulp-cli`) to work with this project. After that, install local dependencies with `npm install`.

Then, you can run `npm start` or `gulp` to use the app in the development mode.

Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
